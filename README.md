# Card & Krueger (1994) DID Replication

## Track A: The Causal Policy Track (Difference-in-Differences)

This project replicates Card & Krueger (1994), which studies the impact of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey on fast-food employment relative to Pennsylvania.

The analysis follows a Difference-in-Differences (DID) identification strategy to estimate the causal effect of the policy change under the parallel trends assumption.
