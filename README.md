# Card & Krueger (1994) DID Replication

## Track A: The Causal Policy Track (Difference-in-Differences)

This project replicates Card & Krueger (1994), *Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania*, which studies the impact of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey on fast-food employment relative to Pennsylvania.

The paper investigates whether an increase in the minimum wage in New Jersey reduced employment in fast-food restaurants relative to neighboring Pennsylvania. Using a Difference-in-Differences research design, the study estimates the causal effect of the policy change under the parallel trends assumption.
